# Embedded-System-Project-

An embedded system is a specialized computing system that performs dedicated functions within a larger mechanical or electrical system. Unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are designed for specific tasks and often operate with limited resources like memory, power, or processing speed.

⚙️ Key Characteristics
Dedicated Functionality: They perform a particular job and are not meant for multitasking.

Real-Time Operation: Many respond to input in real time (e.g., anti-lock brakes in cars).

Compact and Efficient: Built for space-saving and low power usage.

Tightly Integrated: Embedded into the hardware they control.
